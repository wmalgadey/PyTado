PyTado is a Python module implementing an interface to the Tado web API. It allows a user to interact with their
Tado heating system for the purposes of monitoring or controlling their heating system, beyond what Tado themselves
currently offer.

It is hoped that this module might be used by those who wish to tweak their Tado systems, and further optimise their
heating setups.

## Disclaimer

Besides owning a Tado system, I have no connection with the Tado company themselves. PyTado was created for my own use,
and for others who may wish to experiment with personal Internet of Things systems. I receive no help (financial or
otherwise) from Tado, and have no business interest with them. This software is provided without warranty, according to
the GNU Public Licence version 3, and should therefore not be used where it may endanger life, financial stakes, or
cause discomfort and inconvenience to others.

## Example basic usage

    >>> from PyTado.interface import Tado
    >>> t = Tado('my@username.com', 'mypassword')
    >>> climate = t.get_climate(zone=1)

## Usage
```python
"""Example client for PyTado"""

from PyTado.interface.interface import Tado


def main() -> None:
    """Retrieve all zones, once successfully logged in"""
    tado = Tado(username="mail@email.com", password="password")  # nosec
    zones = tado.get_zones()
    print(zones)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Note: for developers, you can create an `example_dev.py` file in the root of the project to test your changes. This file will be ignored by the `.gitignore` file.

## Contributing

We are very open to the community's contributions - be it a quick fix of a typo, or a completely new feature!

You don't need to be a Python expert to provide meaningful improvements. To learn how to get started, check out our
[Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/wmalgadey/econnect-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first, and ask for help
in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wmalgadey/PyTado/discussions) if you have questions.

## Development

We welcome external contributions, even though the project was initially intended for personal use. If you think some
parts could be exposed with a more generic interface, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/wmalgadey/PyTado/issues)
to discuss your suggestion.

### Setting up a devcontainer

The easiest way to start, is by opening a CodeSpace here on GitHub, or by using
the [Dev Container][devcontainer] feature of Visual Studio Code.

### Dev Environment

To contribute to this repository, you should first clone your fork and then setup your development environment. Clone
your repository as follows (replace yourusername with your GitHub account name):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PyTado.git
cd PyTado
```

Then, to create your development environment and install the project with its dependencies, execute the following
commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Create and activate a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip and install all projects and their dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e '.[all]'

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Coding Guidelines

To maintain a consistent codebase, we utilize [black][1]. Consistency is crucial as it helps readability, reduces errors,
and facilitates collaboration among developers.

To ensure that every commit adheres to our coding standards, we've integrated [pre-commit hooks][2]. These hooks
automatically run `black` before each commit, ensuring that all code changes are automatically checked and formatted.

For details on how to set up your development environment to make use of these hooks, please refer to the
[Development][3] section of our documentation.

### Testing

Ensuring the robustness and reliability of our code is paramount. Therefore, all contributions must include at least one
test to verify the intended behavior.

To run tests locally, execute the test suite using `pytest` with the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/ --cov --cov-branch -vv
```
